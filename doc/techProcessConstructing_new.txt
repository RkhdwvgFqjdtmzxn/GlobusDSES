TechProcess relate with Operations by edges with numbers (for service of intelMech working). Every Operation is relate with Term, through term - with relating Subgraph (in stage of TechProcess constructing it's not important). Operation may be in context of result simple (result not analyze in further) or complex (result analyze in logical operations). Logical operation is operation where techProcess relate through 2 edges (order number and op-analyze-result number). It return vector of work (liter of operation in next stage). TechProcess should tend to linear structure. Operation may be empty (re-direciing)(?). TechProcess may has 1 branch with next returning to linear. TechProcess may be simple write as stage-by-stage algorithm. Operations in constructing as construct context always, but in time of app-runing app searhh such operations in KB.
